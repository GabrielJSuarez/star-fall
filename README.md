### Super Jump

- After the character jumps from a platform, it can jump one more time in the air.

- You can only super jump if you have just jumped from a platform. This means, if you are falling, you can't use super jump.

### üíº How This Game Designed & Developed

#### Overview
> I wanted to create a platform game. With a movable character on a static window. It can jump and collect entities.

#### Story and Gameplay
>I don't like enemies, for that reason I wanted to make the game race against the time. To achieve this, I got some inspiration from an old game 'Icy Tower'. In that game the objective was to go as high as possible. Since I want to draw myself a frame, I kept my camera static. Which means the perspective is not changing. To make the game has an objective I put limitations like disappearing platforms and the game is ending if you fall down.

#### Level Design
>Also created a leveling system in which the time cycle of the platform moves faster as the level goes high. And levels depends on the stars collected. In every 100 points the game levels up, until 20. Which is a very fastly changing environment.

#### Assets Needed
> To achieve these objectives I collected the assets like the ground, background, star, a sprite sheet and I selected one of my improvisational guitar recordings as background music haha sorry for that. üòä

#### Technical
> To understand Phaser better and to overcome technical blockers quickly, I visited Phasers website and skim documentation.
