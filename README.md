#### Logic

- In every levelup ground creations and removal time intervals speeds up.
- Your objective is to survive with the highest possible score.
- The game has 20 levels on total.

#### Super Jump

- After character makes a jump from a platform, it can jump one more time in the air if the super jump is available.
- You can only super jump if you have just jumped. This means, if you are falling, you can't use super jump.
